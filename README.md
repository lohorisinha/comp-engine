# TalentDash : Salary Transparency for Indian Tech

> **Stop guessing. See real base, bonus, and stock breakdowns, structured by L3/L4/L5 levels.**

This is a compensation intelligence platform inspired by [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), built to show what engineers at top tech companies make.

---

## Live Demo

**[talentdash-live.vercel.app](https://talentdash-live.vercel.app)**

> This is a demo project built for an assessment. The data is seeded and submissions are stored in a real PostgreSQL database, but the app is not intended for production use.

## What Makes It Interesting

- **Level-normalized** — all salaries mapped to standardized L3/L4/L5 levels so you can compare across companies fairly
- **TC breakdown** — every entry shows a visual base/bonus/stock split, not just a total number
- **Company intelligence** — per-company pages with median TC, avg comp by level, and level distribution charts
- **Side-by-side comparison** — pick any two salaries and see a full breakdown diff with a winner banner
- **Anonymous submissions** — anyone can contribute a salary via the submit form, hits the real API
